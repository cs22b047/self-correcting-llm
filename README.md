# Self-Correcting LLM System

## Project Setup Instructions

```
2. Install dependencies

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. Start the web server

```
python app.py
```

## Use Case Chosen

**Legal Clause Explanation**  
I focused on interpreting complex legal clauses into plain English and ensuring the explanation is both correct and clear through a self-correcting LLM pipeline.


## System Architecture & Prompt Strategy

### Pipeline Structure

1. **Input:** Legal Clause
2. **Stage 1 – Generator (LLM-1):**
   - Role: Legal assistant
   - Task: Explain the clause in plain English
3. **Stage 2 – Critic (LLM-2):**
   - Role: Legal reviewer
   - Task: Identify inaccuracies or ambiguities in the explanation
4. **Stage 3 – Rewriter:**
   - Applies suggested corrections for improved output

### Prompt Design

#### Generation Prompt (LLM-1)

> You are a legal assistant. Explain the following legal clause in simple, plain English:
>
> Clause: "{{LEGAL_CLAUSE}}"

#### Critique Prompt (LLM-2)

> You are a legal reviewer. Review the following explanation of a legal clause.
>
> Clause: "{{LEGAL_CLAUSE}}"
>
> Explanation: "{{LLM1_OUTPUT}}"
>
> Evaluate for: factual accuracy, clarity, completeness, and legal precision.
>
> Your output format:
>
> ```
> [Critique]
> ...
> [Suggested Correction]
> ...
> ```

#### Feedback Loop Prompt

> You previously explained the clause:
> "{{LEGAL_CLAUSE}}"
>
> Your explanation was:
> "{{LLM1_OUTPUT}}"
>
> A reviewer suggested improvements:
> "{{CRITIQUE}}"
>
> Based on this feedback, write an improved explanation.


## Error Types: What It Can and Can’t Catch

### Can Catch:
- Misinterpretation of legal terminology
- Over-simplification of important legal concepts
- Ambiguities or lack of clarity
- Incomplete explanations

### Cannot Catch:
- Errors in the original clause itself
- Highly domain-specific legal subtleties requiring expert judgment
- Hallucinated corrections from the critic model


## Test Runs
| Test # | Legal Clause | Initial Explanation | Critique | Suggested Correction | Final Explanation |
|--------|--------------|---------------------|----------|----------------------|-------------------|
| 1 | The tenant shall not make any structural alterations or improvements to the leased premises without the prior written consent of the landlord. | The tenant is not allowed to change the building unless the landlord says it's okay. | The explanation is clear, but "change the building" is vague and may not emphasize that written permission is required. | Specify "written consent" and clarify "structural alterations". | The tenant cannot make major changes to the structure of the property unless they first get written permission from the landlord. |
| 2 | The contractor agrees to indemnify and hold harmless the client from any claims, damages, or liabilities arising out of the contractor’s performance. | The contractor promises to protect the client from legal or financial problems caused by the contractor's work. | Mostly accurate, but lacks legal precision regarding "indemnify" and "hold harmless". | Include legal meaning and mention both financial and legal protection. | The contractor agrees to take responsibility and protect the client from any legal or financial consequences caused by the contractor's work. |
| 3 | Payment for services rendered shall be due within thirty (30) days of receipt of invoice. Late payments shall incur interest at the rate of 1.5% per month. | You must pay within 30 days after getting the bill. If you're late, interest will be added each month. |  Correct but informal. “Getting the bill” is vague, and interest rate could be more formally stated. | Use formal terms like “receipt of invoice” and clarify interest application. | Payment is due within 30 days of receiving the invoice. If payment is late, a 1.5% monthly interest fee will be charged. |
| 4 | The employee agrees not to disclose any confidential information obtained during employment to third parties. | The employee promises not to share secret work information with others. | Too casual and vague. Doesn’t specify "confidential" or time scope (e.g., during or after employment). | Mention "confidential information" explicitly and clarify time frame. | The employee agrees not to share any confidential information they obtained during their job with anyone outside the company. |
| 5 | Either party may terminate this agreement upon a 30-day written notice without cause. | Either side can end the contract with 30 days’ written notice. | Accurate, but lacks legal phrasing and doesn’t mention that no reason is required. | Emphasize "without cause" and maintain formal tone. | Either party may end the agreement for any reason by giving 30 days’ written notice. |



## Evaluation

### Accuracy
I compared the initial explanation generated by the LLM with the self-corrected explanation to assess:

- Whether factual errors were resolved
- Whether key legal terms were preserved or clarified
- Whether clarity improved without loss of legal meaning

Across 5 test runs, the self-corrected output improved the initial response in 4/5 cases.

###  Overcorrection

In this system, overcorrection occured when the model hallucinated critique content. 

Because flan-t5-base is not domain-specific, some corrections slightly altered legal phrasing without introducing factual errors.

The feedback loop helped reduce this effect to a certain level.

## Code Implementation

### Tech stack used

Model: google/flan-t5-base via transformers

Pipeline type: text2text-generation

Environment: CPU-based local execution (works without API keys)

Language: Python 3.10

### Reasoning for model selection, limitations, and alternate options

#### 1. Reasoning:

flan-t5 is a model that is trained on a diverse set of instructions, making it effective for tasks like explanation, summarization, and critique.

flan-t5 is relatively small (~250M parameters) and is easy to run on CPUs without requiring GPUs or cloud services.

Unlike OpenAI's APIs, google's flan-t5 is open source. So, using it here, in the context of an assesment, makes sense for me.

#### 2. Limitations

flan-t5 is not trained specifically on legal text. So, its interpretations may lack domain-specific precision.

Limited context window makes it unsuitable for long or multi-clause legal texts.

Runs slowly on CPU for longer prompts or multi-step pipelines, making it a bad choice in a production setting.

#### 3. Alternate options

LexLM : It is a legal domain fine-tuned version of LLaMA. Trained on US case law, contracts, statutes. And is also open-source!

Spellbook : GPT-based assistant for contract drafting and review. Not open-source.


## Web Interfce

I have also implemented a basic web interface that uses a flask backend to run the above LLM logic.
